<h4>
Football is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each, with a break between the second and third periods called “halftime” that is normally 12 minutes long.
While the clock is active, the game is divided into even shorter segments called “plays" or "downs."

A play begins when the ball is moved from the ground into the hands of the players, and ends when either the ball hits the ground,or the person holding the ball is 
tackled and his knee or elbow touches the ground. 
When a play is over, an official called a referee, places the ball on the yard marker which corresponds to his or her judgment of the place where the forward progress
of the player with the ball was stopped. Each team has 4 downs and within those downs, they have to make ten yards from the line of scrimmage (the starting point).
If the team fails to do so within the 4 downs, the offensive team has to hand over the ball to the opposing team. If the offense succeeds in taking the ball 10 yards 
in the 4 downs they get another 4 downs to move the ball 10 yards. The teams have 30 seconds to get into formation and begin the next play.

Play time can stop for few different reasons: 
If a player runs out of bounds, a penalty is called, a flag is thrown, or a pass is thrown but not caught by anybody (an incomplete pass), the clock will stop while 
referees sort everything out.

Penalties are indicated by referees, who throw yellow flags onto the field when they see a violation. This lets everyone on the field know that a penalty has been 
called. Penalties normally result in the offending team losing between 5 - 15 yards of field position.[4] There are many penalties, but some of the most common are 
“offside” (someone was on the wrongside of the line of scrimmage when the ball was snapped), “holding” (a player grabbed another player with his hands, and either 
player doesn't have the ball, instead of blocking him properly), "false start" (When a player moves before the ball is snapped), "Unsportsmanlike conduct" (When a 
player does something that doesn't show good sportsmanship, and “clipping” (someone contacted an opposing player other than the ball carrier from behind and below the 
waist).</h4>
